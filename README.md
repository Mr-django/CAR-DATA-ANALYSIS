<b>1. Car Data Analysis Using MySQL and Excel<b>
In this project, I analyze large datasets of cars using MySQL for data extraction and Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The objective was to uncover key insights related to car models, pricing, performance, and customer preferences.
<b>2. Presentations & Visualization<b/>
I created presentations on PowerPoint, explaining the findings and insights derived from data analysis. I also developed various charts and visualizations using Excel and PowerPoint to make the data more understandable and visually appealing.
